# How to add support for a new device

This documentation offers a step by step guide on how to add support for a new device. We assume you have the WindesheartSDK project cloned and open in Visual Studio.

### 1. Add new device folder

To start, you need a folder to put all your code in. In the Devices folder, create a new folder named after your device. Please follow the format as shown  in the MiBand3 folder. Put your models inside a Models folder, Helpers in a Helpers folder, and so on.

### 2. Add your own Device class extending BLEDevice
Inside your newly created folder, add a "Models" folder, then create a new class in there. 
This class should have the exact same name as your folder:

The class also has to extend from BLEDevice. Because of this, you're forced to implement all abstract methods that class contains.

In theory this class can do all the logic for your device, however it is **STRONGLY** recommended that you have different services that handle the implementation, as seen in MiBand3.cs:

A few things you need to have in this class:
* Set BLEDevice's ConnectionCallback of BleDevice in your Connect method.
* Set BLEDevice's DisconnectionCallback of BleDevice in your SubscribeToDisconnect method.

As seen in the example below:

## 3. Add your code
Now its time to implement everything! To keep things organized and clean, please use different services for different tasks. Mi Band 3 is a good example for this.

If your device doesn't support an action provided by the BLEDevice class, just throw a NotImplementedException. 
For example, if your device doesn't support sleep tracking, you do this:

## 4. Edit the GetDevice method
The last step is to edit the GetDevice method inside of  `BluetoothService.cs`
This method returns the correct BLEDevice dependent of it's name. Please note that `var name` is the Bluetooth device name. There might be two or more names for one device (in case of the Mi Band 3).

And that should be it! Now, when scanning for devices it should detect and return your device! Please make sure everything works as expected before submitting a pull request.
